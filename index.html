        <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>

        <p>Starting this course I thought I had a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, and to a point, I did. However the picture I had was incomplete; it was missing crucial pieces of design and syntax to the languages that I had never heard of before.</p>
        
        <p>I learned right from the get-go that coding was a team sport, and it was much more fun that way. Having a team forces one to organize their code so that it becomes easily readable to your teammates, and in the process, it becomes more readable to yourself as well.</p>

        <p>Semantic markup was a great tool for accomplishing this in HTML. The ability to replace a bunch of div's and comments into a single article, section, or aside tag immensely cleans up code. However in CSS I am still using comments to organize sections of styling. I have recently learned about CSS variables, but I don't have enough practice with them to tell if they really help this problem the same way Semantic Markup helps HTML code.</p>

        <p>GIT: What is it? What does it do? Why bother? The answers to all these questions and more I encountered this week at NSS. I am learning to love git for it's ability to organize code into commits and branches. I love being able to work without fear of breaking something and ruining my site.</p>

        <p>In the same vein, learning the Command Line has been a very useful tool. It feels great to type in a single command to complete several tasks at once.</p>

        <p>Overall, I have learned more than I thought I would in the first couple of weeks here at NSS, and I can barely wait to learn more!</p>
